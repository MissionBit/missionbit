# M6: GitHub Pages

### Learning Objectives

- Publish the adventure game using GitHub Pages
- Merge the adventure game code from different team members
- Pull the adventure game code into local computers

### Publishing multiple websites
Now that you've created and published your first website, you might be wondering if you can use GitHub Pages to publish other projects. After all you needed to create the repo with a very specific name for that to work, i.e., _our_user_name.github.io_.

The answer is __yes__! ![Yes!](https://media.giphy.com/media/nFjDu1LjEADh6/giphy.gif =50%)

Once you've created that first _your_user_name.github.io_ repo and published it with GitHub Pages, you can publish as many projects as you want! (within reasonable [limits](help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), of course)

Let's see how to do that.

### Step 1: Create the new repo
_(If you already have one, skip this step.)_
If you don't have a repo on GitHub, but you already have a project folder:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Go to File >> Add Local Repository...
3. Find and select the folder where your code is, then click "Add Repository"
4. In "Summary," write "Initial commit" and click "commit to master"
5. On the top, click "Publish branch"

### Step 2: Publish the repo
1. Go to the repo on GitHub (github.com/_your_user_name_/_your_repo_name_) and navigate to "Settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and make sure "master branch" is selected in "Source." Save and voila! Your website is published!

2. Note that the link to your website is _your_user_name_.github.io/_your_repo_name_. This is not a coincidence. Once you've created that first GitHub Page, you can publish any of your other repos just by selecting a Source for GitHub Pages, and the URL will always follow this format.

Pretty easy, huh?
