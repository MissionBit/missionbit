### The User
You are responsible for giving `commands` to The Shell to accomplish the current goal. These are the commands you can use:

#### ls
`ls` stands for `list`. The Shell will tell you what files and folders are in the directory where it is currently standing.
#### cd `<name-of-directory>`
`cd` stands for `change directory`. The Shell will move to the directory you tell it to, but only if it exists.
#### cd ..
`..` is a special keyword that means `the parent of the current directory`. The Shellwill move backwards one directory when you give it this command.
#### mkdir `<name-of-directory>`
`mkdir` stands for `make directory`. The Shell wll create a new directory with the specified name inside of the directory where it is currently standing.
#### rm -r `<name-of-directory>`
`rm -r` stands for `remove recursive`. The Shell will delete the directory that you specify. Use this if you accidentally told The Shell to create a directory in the wrong place.
#### bash `<name-of-shell-script>`
`bash` is the name of the computer language you are using to give commands to The Shell. Once you find the `create_log.sh` script, use this command to run it.
#### mv `<name-of-file-to-move>` `<path-to-folder-where-you-want-to-move-the-file>`
`mv` stands for `move`. The Shell will move the specified file to the specified destination directory.

NOTE: There is no "undo" command. If you say a command that works, you have to live with the consequences.
