Part of this exercise is about breaking down a large, complex task into manageable chunks.

Spend 3-5 minutes discussing or brainstorming as a class how to break down this challenge.

Here is a suggested breakdown:

1) Start with just one block--don't worry about making 9 blocks all at once.

2) Once you have one square colored block working, then move on to making more blocks with different colors.

3) Once you are able to make multiple blocks, then start to think about how to arrange them in a grid.
