Hey! Syn and I will keep this page up-to-date with links to resources we mention in class.

### HTML/CSS/JS References
- [HTML Cheat Sheet](https://hostingfacts.com/html-cheat-sheet/)
- [Mozilla: Getting Started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
- [w3schools: CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)

### Online Courses
- [codecademy: Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website)
- [Udacity: Intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001) - Video-based course. You can do it from your phone by installing the Udacity app.

### Other Resources
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - This is a block-based programming language. It is not HTML/CSS/JS, but it introduces a lot of coding concepts with blocks, so that you don't have to worry as much about typing every letter and symbol right. Instead of typing commands, you drag blocks together.
