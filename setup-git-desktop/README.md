### Steps

0) Open the Github Desktop app. (It's in your dock, or you can press command + space and type 'github desktop'.)

1) Log in with your username and password

2) Set your username and email address

3) Using the Finder app or the `mv` command in the terminal, rename your `adventure-game` directory to `adventure-game-old`.

4) Go back to Github Desktop and clone the `adventure-game` repo (see steps below):

  -- a) File -> Clone Repository...
  
  -- b) Select the `adventure-game` repo from the list of repos. If you do not see the `adventure-game` repo in the list, have the person on your team who created the repo log in to github.com and add you as a collaborator from the repo settings page.
  
  -- c) Click the `Choose...` button and select the Desktop folder. Under `Local Path`, it should say: `/Users/missionbit/Desktop/adventure-game`.
  
  -- d) Click `Clone`.

5) In the Finder app, open the Desktop directory. You should see `adventure-game` and `adventure-game-old` inside.
  
  -- a) Delete any unnecessary files in `adventure-game`.
  
  -- b) Copy all your work (files and folders) from `adventure-game-old` into `adventure-game`. __Watch out: Files with the same name will get overwritten. Check to see if any of the files in `adventure-game-old` have the same name as files in `adventure-game`. If you want to keep both versions, change the name of your copy before moving it into the shared `adventure-game` repo.__
  
  -- c) Go back to GitHub Desktop and look at the list of changes you made one by one. GitHub Desktop will show a `+` next to new lines and a `-` next to deleted lines. Make sure you didn't overwrite anything from `adventure-game` that you wanted to keep.
  
  -- d) If everything looks good, type a summary of your changes into the `Summary` box, and click the `Commit to master` button to save your changes.

6) Now that your changes are saved to your local repo, we need to push them to the online repo so your teammates can access them. Click the `Push origin` button in the upper right of the Github Desktop app.

7) In the future, to download your teammates' changes to your computer, all you will need to do is click on the `Fetch origin` button followed by the `Pull origin` button in the upper-right.

8) Repeat this process one computer at a time on your teammates' laptops.
