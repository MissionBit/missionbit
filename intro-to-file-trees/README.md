### The File Tree Challenge

The point of this challenge is to:
1) Understand how files and folders are organized on your computer.
2) Become __extremely__ comfortable moving files to specific folders in your file tree (i.e. be able to do it with your eyes closed).
3) Practice figuring out if you did something correctly without asking your instructor.

#### Vocab Tip

Some people say __directory__ or __subdirectory__ instead of __folder__. All of these words mean the same thing. 

### Getting Started

0) Download [file-tree-challenge.zip](file-tree-challenge.zip) and save it on your desktop.

1) Double-click `file-tree-challenge.zip` to __extract__ the contents. You should see a folder called `file-tree-challenge`. Delete the zip file once you've extracted it.

2) Grab a marker and an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.

### Challenge 1

Your first challenge is to draw a __tree diagram__ that shows how the folders inside of `file-tree-challenge` are organized.

A common way to draw a tree diagram is like this:

But you can represent the tree however you want. For example, you could use an indented list:

```
- Music
-- Kanye West
--- Late Registration
-- Sampa the Great
--- The Great Mixtape
--- Birds and the BEE9
```

__The only requirement__ is that __your diagram makes it clear which folders live inside of which other folders.__ In other words, the parent/child/sibling relationships must be clear.

#### How do I know if I did it right?

Good question. Once you think you did it right, show your drawing to whoever is sitting next to you. Did you draw the same tree?

Compare your tree to at least two other people's trees. If all the trees agree, then you probably did it right :)

### Challenge 2

Now download [a-bunch-of-files.zip](a-bunch-of-files.zip) and save it to your desktop. __Extract__ the contents just like you did above. You should see a directory called `a-bunch-of-files` with a bunch of files inside.

__Your second challenge__ is to __move each file from `a-bunch-of-files` to the correct folder inside of `file-tree-challenge`.__

For example, a kangaroo is a marsupial, so it should go in the `marsupial` directory.

#### How do I know if I did it right?

Same as before--__when you think you are finished__, compare your directories to someone else's. Did you put the same files in the same places?

TIP: When comparing your directory contents, it will help to view the files sorted alphabetically.
