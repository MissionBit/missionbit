### Digital Poetry Project

Young Hae Chang Heavy Industries are two artists based in Seoul, Korea. A lot of their work is about immigration, power, and other social justice issues.

Your project can be written in any language and be about anything you want at all. It does not need to be about a social issue. I am just using their work as an example because I think it shows how you can combine words and music and video in a simple way for a powerful effect.

### Steps

#### Setup

0) Create a new `digital-poetry-project` folder on your Desktop

1) In brackets, go to File -> Open Folder... and select your new `digital-poetry-project` folder.

2) Save a new `index.html` file into this folder. Make sure it has a `<body></body>` tag.

3) Save a new `index.js` file. Use a `<script>` tag to connect your script file (`index.js`) to your html page (`index.html`) like in the 9 flowers project. If you forget how, look at the `index.html` for your 9 flowers project.

4) Test to see if your script tag works by adding this to your `index.js` and loading the page:

```
document.write('Hello world again!')
```
